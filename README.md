# Tyrion - Word Embedding Autoencoder

An autoencoder to calculate word embeddings as mentioned in Lebret/Collobert paper 2015

Runs the model mentined in http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4930 on set of text files stored in directory.

Requirements:

1. Numpy http://www.numpy.org/

2. Theano http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html

3. Scipy http://www.scipy.org/install.html

Usage:

First run train.py with arguments specified in help, it will generate the embedding file.
A sample data folder is provided in tyrion folder with very small wiki dump, run train on it to make sure model is generated without bug ( due to small corpus size, it won't give good results in finding closest words, use larger corpus for that)

>> python train.py --help

To generate word embeddings and to find closest words to a word, use utils module in tyrion. Ex.

>> from tyrion import utils

>> embedding = utils.gen_embedding('word')

>> close_words = utils.closest_words('word',n=10)


Todo: (Prioritywise)

1. Implement a closely related paper on phrase embeddings (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05703) (ICML 2015)
2. Try implementing AdaGrad ( for optimization )
